  <p> We all know that earth is not the only planet in the universe or the only planet in the solar system. It is a fact that there is other plants out there some are smaller than earth and most are bigger then earth. But 
  we also know that are planet goes thou some hard times that make are planet dangerous to live. Some are cursed by humans like gangs, murder, fear of nuclear war, kidnappings, and starvation is one, but 
  things like tsunami’s, earthquakes, volcanic emissions, floods, heavy rain, heat wave, tornados, and hurricane/tropical storms are all natural disaster that is not cursed by human hands but are natural disasters 
  by the earth itself. Because of this are planet can be dangerous because we can’t stop these things and as a due to this humans are looking to live in another planet in the future but there are planes out there in 
  the universe that are even more dangers then are own planet. In fact are planet despite the dangers that we face with both humans and people we are living in the best plant in the sole system and in universe. 
  After doing my research I am going to talk about five of the most dangerous plants in the universe.

	<p> Venus is the hottest planet in are solo system despite being second closes to the sun in fact the planets temperature is 870 degrees Fahrenheit (465 degrees Celsius) which is hot enough to melt lead which will 
	burn your whole body. The planet is mostly made up of carbon dioxide making it impossible to breath and a visit to Venus can kill you immediately because of amount of heat that is tramped into the planet 
	known as the runaway greenhouse effect. Venus is also known as earth twin or sister because of the size and mass of the planet is almost similar to our own planet

	<p> As human is looking to abound earth in the future, Mars is the planet we are looking in to we are training people to travel to mars and back safely in the mid 2030 to look for life in mars. Little do we know 
	that mars is completely unfit for human bodies. First of all the planet’s atmosphere is 100 times thinner then earth and it is mainly made up of carbon dioxide which is toxic for humans. It also have an average 
	tempter of -80F -62C which is 2C colder than the average tempter in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole" target="black_">South Pole</a> in the winter. mars is also go thou dust storms which is common on mars but there is a session that these storms that can 
	cover the whole planet within days and can last for mouths and can be seen from space and can stay in the planet atmosphere which can kill humans as the dust on mars is toxic to human health.

	<p> Jupiter is known as a gas giant and it is the biggest planet in are solar system. it atmosphere is mostly made of Molecular Hydrogen and Helium and it has a gravity which is 2.4 times that of earth that means a 
	person who weighs 100 kg (220 lbs) on earth will weigh 240 kg (529 lbs) in Jupiter which will can crush you. It clouds as a temperature of -145 degrees C (-234 degrees F) which can freeze you. Jupiter has a 
	rocking core which is 10 times less on earth but it's surrounded by dense liquid hydrogen which can damage the human body. Jupiter has a big red spot which is twice the size of earth and has a wind which is
